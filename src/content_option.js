I'm a Biological science Honors graduate who fell in love with code and the problem-solving of it all. I love to craft solid & scalable software with great user-experiences. In my spare time you'll catch me trying out new recipes from pinterest, creating fashion content for my YT channel or working on my personal projects that expose me to new programming languages and technologies. I believe people who make tech should be predominantly connected to the problems we face everyday.",
